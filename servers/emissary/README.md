A Raspberry Pi Configured as a LAMP Server

This server will be the device that gets most attacked by virtue of its status
as the primary public-facing device.

USE THIS RASPBERRY PI IMAGE:

Use the NOOBS installer and install Raspbian. This will be the default image
most Raspberry Pi users will install for their projects, so it will be the one
that we will attempt to harden against direct attack.

KEY APPLICATIONS SPECIFIC TO THIS DEVICE:
Wordpress
ModSecurity
