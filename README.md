The Dojo Project

A home network security experiment designed by Bradley Evans, an undergraduate
Electrical Engineering student at the University of California, Riverside.
This project uses Raspberry Pi and Up Board to form a live, running network
that a user / student can secure. Attacks are not simulated; attackers come from
the live internet in the same way that they do on live networks because this
is a live network.
